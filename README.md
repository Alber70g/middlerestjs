# middlerestjs

## Idea
Read [here](/docs/idea.md) for the idea behind it

## Get it running
Very early stage of development. 

First, edit the `sample.js` to use a proper knex connection. There are examples in `sample.js`.

Then, create a database with one table and a bit of data, just to see it working.

Lastly run it:
```
$ node sample.js
```
